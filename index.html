        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b>, which is used to give the content structure.</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS.</li>
          <li>An <b>element</b> is a type of content on a webpage. The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages:
            <br><b>Text elements</b>
            <br><b>Image elements</b>
            <br><b>Header elements</b>
            <br><b>List elements</b>
            </li>
            <li>In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
            <li>Here are some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page:
              <br><b>Meta-related elements</b>
              <br><b>Content division elements</b>
              <br><b>Semantic elements</b>
            </li>
            <li>As developers, one of the first things we must think about when developing a webpage is building a sturdy "frame" using HTML</li>
            <li>First, we use HTML to build a sturdy frame, using HTML elements as our frame’s building blocks. Next, we add CSS to define the style. Finally, we add JavaScript to our HTML structure to make the website interactive.</li>
            <li>These HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets '< >'. These tags contain everything that we want to include in the element. This can include content and even other nested elements.</li>
            <li>However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the 'head' and 'body' elements. </li>
            <li>The 'head' element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the 'head' are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
            <li>The 'body' element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
            <li>Start your HTML code with '!DOCTYPE html' to let the browser know what type of document it is</li>
            <li>Next, use 'html' to know when our HTML document begins</li>
            <li>Add a “lang” attribute to let the browser know what language this site/page is in. For our example, we use 'html lang=”en”' to tell the browser the site is in English.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HEAD Element Basics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The  'head' element is a container for <b>metadata</b>. 'meta' elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won’t see information in the 'head' or 'meta' elements.</li>
          <li>The 'head' element contains the metadata for our web application. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>Inside the 'head' element, we can use the following metadata tags:
            <br>The 'title' element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
            <br>The 'style' element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
            <br>The 'base' element defines the base URL for a webpage.
            <br>The 'link' element connects an external resource to the HTML document.
            <br>The 'meta' element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.
            <br>The 'script' element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>BODY Element Basics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The body of an HTML document includes the content that users see when they look at the webpage in a browser.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called <b>child elements.</b></li>
          <li>The 'body' element is an example of a <b>semantic HTML element.</b>
              <br>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. 
              <br>When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. 
              <br>Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.
          </li>
          <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see <b>non-semantic elements</b> such as 'div' to create a division in the page, or 'span' to create an inline division.
            <br>Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve. The most important thing to keep in mind is that it is best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users.
          </li>
          <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an <b>opening tag</b> and a <b>closing tag.</b></li>
          <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. 
            <br>An <b>element</b> refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag
            <br>A <b>tag</b> refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.
          </li>
          <li>The 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5' and 'h6' elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.
            <br>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from 'h1' to 'h6' to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. 
            <br>In addition, the biggest heading, 'h1', should only appear once on each page.
          </li>
          <li>A list of some child elements inside the 'body' tag
            <br>The 'p' element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.
            <br>The 'ul', 'ol', and 'li' elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.
            <br>The 'img' element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The 'img' element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image
            <br>In an 'img src=”” alt=””' tag, the alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.
            <br>The 'br' element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. 
            <br>For hyperlinks, the 'a' element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.
          </li>
          <li>The 'footer' appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <h3>Git Basics & Git/GitHub Comparison</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Git</b> is the most commonly used version control software among developers and a tool that you will likely use on the job.</li>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.
            <br>Git is accessed through the command line on our computer
            <br>Git is used to save and track versions of your code. It is also used to initiate a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.
            <br>Git is a great tool for tracking our versions and code, but can only be used locally
          </li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com"><b>GitHub</b></a> is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.
            <br>Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.
            <br>It is important to note that while GitHub is popular, there are other Git-based repository hosting services, such as <b>Bitbucket</b> and <b>SourceForge</b>. However, for this course, we will use GitHub, which is free, to share work and collaborate.
          </li>
          <li>Review Git cheatsheet <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">here</a></li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>Be sure to set up a global username and email using the following:
            <ul>
              <li>git config --global --replace-all user.name "username"</li>
              <li>git config --global --replace-all user.email "email@email"</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Repositories</h4></li>
          <li>Repositories are directories or files that contain all project files</li>
          <li>Repositories can be made locally using git init, but we will creating repositories in GitHub and then cloning them to our local machine</li>
          <li><h4>Branches</h4></li>
          <li>There can be different types of branches:</li>
          <li><b>Feature branch</b>
            <br>When a developer is working on implementing or improving a single feature of the project
          </li>  
          <li><b>Develop branch</b>
            <br>When a single or team of developers is working on a major feature or set of features that may drastically change the product
            <br>These branches often have “sub” feature branches for all these features to be worked on, and will be pulled to the develop branch first before being eventually deployed to the main branch
          </li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>You should always use git pull origin main to ensure you are working with the current version of the main branch</li>
          <li><h4>Stage and Commit</h4></li>
          <li>To stage changed files in your branch:
            <br>git add -A OR git add [file]
            <br>use git restore [file] to remove files from stage
          </li>
          <li>To commit your changes to the branch, use git commit -m "[message on what was changed]" </li>
          <li>Every commit should be a unique change to be able to succesfully and easily track and remedy bugs</li>
          <li>Once you have commited, you should merge (if working locally) or pull (if working with GitHub)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>GitHub Basics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Github is the web interface for Git, a version control software, that allows multiple people to make separate changes to a program at the same time without getting in each others way</li>
          <h4><li>Github terms</li></h4>
          <li><b>Repository or repo</b>
            <br>Every project on Github is a repository

          </li>
          <li><b>Fork</b>
            <br>A new repository that inherits from a parent “upstream” repo. It is used to suggest changes to an “upstream” public repo by someone who doesn’t have access to edit in the repo’s home org.

            <br>Discuss and review (should be done by another teammate)
            <br>Then merge and deploy your changes
          </li>
          <li><h4>Set up SSH Keys to Initally Connect Git to GitHub</h4></li>
          <li>To initally connect your local Git to GitHub, you will need to create an SSH key in terminal and conenct it to your GitHub account</li>
          <li>To create and connect your local SSH key to GitHub:
            <ol>
              <li>First, check for SSH keys; following the instructions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys">here</a></li>
              <li>If you alreay have a public AND private SSH key, you can skip the next step and move on to step 4</li>
              <li>To create a new SSH key, follow the steps <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key">here</a></li>
              <li>Next, you will add the SSH to ssh-agent following the steps <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent">here</a></li>
              <li>Finally, you will add the SSH key to your GitHub account following the steps <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">here</a></li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><h4>Creating a Repository</h4></li>
          <li>When creating a new repo:
            <br>We should usually include a readme.md file
            <br>We should usually include a .gitignore file
            <br>(This allows us to have files in the repo that we do NOT want uploaded to the cloud. (i.e., ssh keys or login info))
            <br>We should almost always select a license
            <br>MIT license is the most open/unrestricted license we can choose and will be the one we choose in this course
          </li>
          <li>When naming a repository, it's important to remember the following conventions:
            <br>Be unique and descriptive for each repository name.
            <br>Use all lowercase letters.
            <br>Use dashes; we can't have spaces in our repository names, so we use dashes instead.
            <br>Be consistent! Our GitHub account will follow us throughout our web development career, so show it some love.
          </li>
          <li>Add a description to your repository. Be concise and clear with your project descriptions.</li>
          <li>Use “git clone [GitHub provided URL]” to download your repo to your local machine
            <br>Make sure you are in the directory that you want to clone it to
            <br>User git remote -v to track what URLs you need to use to fetch or push files
          </li>
          <li>Create GitHub Issues using Markdown</li>
          <li>GitHub offers a task management tool called GitHub issues, which gives developers and teams an easy way to keep track of key tasks and progress. Think of it as a built-in to-do list right inside our GitHub repository.</li>
          <li>GitHub issues can also help teams to do the following:
            <br>Track, organize, and communicate ideas, tasks, bugs, and enhancements.
            <br>Identify bottlenecks or blockers that could prevent work progress.
            <br>Avoid duplicating work by assigning tasks or issues.
          </li>
          <li><h4>Pulling Branch Changes, Pull Requests, and Merges</h4></li>
          <li>To pull your branch changes from your local machine in Git</li>
          <ul>
            <li>First, double check you are working with the latest version of the code with git pull origin main</li>
            <li>Next, push your changes for your branch with git push origin [branch name]</li>
            <li>If you are done with the branch, you should pull and merge in GitHub, and then delete the branch on both GitHub and your local machine</li>
            <li>To delete a branch from your local machine (should only be done AFTER you pull and merge), use git checkout main to switch to your main branch, then use git branch -d [branch name] to delete</li>
            <li>Once you delete a branch, you should pull your main again to ensure all changes are up to date using git pull origin main</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Once you have pulled the branch changes to GitHub using the first two steps above, you should create a pull request</li>
            <ul>
              <li>To do this, first go to GitHub repository in your browser</li>
              <li>Then switch to the branch you want to pull from the branch drop down menu</li>
              <li>Then click "Compare & pull request</li>
              <li>Then, give a detailed yet concise description of what was changed, then click create pull request</li>
              <li>In most professional and/or collaborative settings, this would now go a colleague or superior for review</li>
              <li>Once you create the pull request (and if needed, it is approved by someone), you can now merge your changes with the main branch using "Merge Pull Request"</li>
            </ul>
