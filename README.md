# Prework Study Guide Webpage for University of Minnesota + edX Bootcamp Prework Notes

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for UoM Bootcamp students who were going through the Prework, in addition to being a great reference point for the basics in the subjects it contains. It contains detailed notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 

The project was built with the heavy intention to give a detailed yet concise source for all the notes taken during the prework modules. It allowed a very structured and organized place for the notes, in addition to formatting options that a word processor may not easily give (ie. the  <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> elements).

This solves the issue of having to comb through pages of notes, in addition to multiple documents of notes, by having them in a single, organized space.

This project helped teach many formatting and basic coding techniques for the languages it is written in. Additionally, it helped teach techniques that were not included in the base code or lessons.
